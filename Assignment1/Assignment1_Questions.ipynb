    "The goal of this assignment is to develop an understanding of how the brain performs computations at the neuronal level. To do so, you will develop several models of a spiking neuron. By the end of this assignment, you should a) be comfortable with developing models of spiking neurons at different levels of abstraction, from the biologically plausible H-H model to the phenomenological LIF model; b) understand how neurons use their firing rate to represent continuous-valued information; and c) understand the trade-offs involved in spike-based information representation. \n",

Additionally, please note the following:\n",

    "1. To ensure depolarization is interpreted as a positive event, indicating the influx of positive ions into a neuron resulting in increased positivity at points of equilibrium voltage or constant, the sign on relevant variables should be reversed.\n",

Opening Ca²⁺ channels depolarizes the membrane (like Na⁺), but the entering Ca²⁺ also triggers the activation of Ca²⁺-dependent K⁺ channels that hyperpolarize the cell and shape firing patterns.

    "\n",
    "Building on the Hodgkin–Huxley model and the calcium-extended version from the previous question, we now introduce **chloride dynamics**. At rest, chloride concentration is typically higher outside the neuron (roughly 120 mM) than inside (~5–15 mM), so the chloride equilibrium potential (E_Cl) is usually close to or slightly more negative than the resting membrane potential. Unlike sodium, potassium, and calcium, the role of chloride in neurons is more modulatory: its intracellular concentration determines whether synaptic inputs (e.g., GABA-A or glycine receptor activation) are inhibitory or excitatory. Chloride levels in the neuron are regulated by cation–chloride cotransporters such as NKCC1 (which imports Cl⁻) and KCC2 (which exports Cl⁻), but the exact kinetics vary across development and cell type.\n",

    "Using the code in 2a as a reference, your task is to:\n",
    "* Propose a simple dynamical system to represent intracellular chloride concentration.\n",
    "\n",

    "You will:\n",
    "1) Compare somatic EPSPs for **proximal (soma) vs distal (dendrite)** inputs (attenuation & kinetics).\n",
    "2) Add a dendritic **I_h** current and perform **impedance spectroscopy** to reveal **resonance**.\n",
    "3) Demonstrate **BAC firing**: a back‑propagating AP (from somatic spike) plus a distal EPSP facilitate a second somatic spike depending on timing.\n",

    "**Deliverables:** \n",
    "- Labeled plots for each subtask:\n",
    "  - (3a) Somatic voltage traces for proximal and distal EPSPs; annotate peaks and rise times; report attenuation ratio and 20–80% rise times.\n",
    "  - (3b) |Z(f)| vs. frequency, with I_h on/off; mark resonance frequency.\n",
    "  - (3c) Example voltage traces showing BAC pairing (both facilitated and non‑facilitated cases); plot binary spike‑occurrence vs. Δ and report facilitation window.\n",
    "- Short interpretations for each result (1–3 sentences each), commenting on the biophysical intuition (filtering by cable coupling, resonance due to I_h, timing dependence of BAC facilitation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical tips & units\n",
    "- Time in ms, voltages in mV, currents in nA, conductances in nS, capacitances in pF.\n",
    "- Use a sufficiently small integration dt (e.g., ≤ 0.1 ms or as in the existing code) to capture fast spikes and rise times.\n",
    "- When measuring subthreshold metrics, ensure no spikes occur (reduce input amplitude or increase threshold/clamp as needed).\n",

    "# Question 6: Tuning Membrane Properties of the LIF neuron\n",
    "## 6a.\n",
    "In this question, you will understand how to tune the membrane properties of an LIF neuron. First, generate 19 inputs in the form of random spike trains of length 50, i.e. 50 timesteps. The inputs will have different levels of probabilities for spike generation, that ranges between 0.1 and 1.0 with step size of 0.05. In other words, you will create 19 spike trains with the first spike train having the probability of 0.1 to generate spikes at any timestep, the second spike train will have the spike generation probability of 0.15, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Simulate an LIF neuron with the parameters defined in Question 3b. You will now drive the neuron model with the 19 randomly generated input spike trains that you have created, and compute the output spike train. \n",
    "At the same time, compute the input firing rate and output firing rate for each simulation. Firing rate is defined as the mean of the spike train, i.e. total number of spikes/timesteps"

In this exercise, you will learn how to encode real-world data into spikes that can then be fed as inputs to the spiking neuron. We will take a digit from the popular MNIST dataset as an example. First let's see what a sample digit from the MNIST image looks like. For this, we need to create a loader for the MNIST dataset using a Pytorch function called datasets.MNIST. You do not need to know what a loader is for now. Just understand the two important arguments of the function: The first argument is the directory where the MNIST dataset will be downloaded. The third argument is the set download option. This should be true for the first time when you run this cell to allow you to download the MNIST data into your directory. You can set it to false if the MNIST data has already been downloaded. "
